# Mancala

A class project to program a python version of mancala that will learn how to beat us at the game.

# Mancala Rules

1. Play always moves around the board in a counter-clockwise circle (to the right)
2.  The store on your right belongs to you. That is where you keep the seeds you win.
3.  The six pits near you are your pits.
4. Only use one hand to pick up and put down seeds.
5. Once you touch the seeds in a pit, you must move those seeds.
6. Only put seeds in your own store, not your opponent’s store.

# How to play
On a turn, a player picks up all the seeds in one pit and “sows” them to the right, placing one
seed/stone in each of the pits along the way. If you come to your store, then add a seed to your store
and continue. You may end up putting seeds in your opponent’s pits along the way.
Play alternates back and forth, with opponents picking up the seeds in one of their pits and
distributing them one at a time into the pits on the right, beginning in the pit immediately to the
right.The game is over when one player’s pits are completely empty. The other player takes the seeds
remaining in her pits and puts those seeds in her store. Count up the seeds. Whoever has the most
seeds wins.
